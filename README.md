Bike Sales Dashboard
Ford launched an internal audit of the current car market scenario to understand customer buying patterns.

They hired an India-based marketing agency to collect data points and conduct a thorough analysis of various factors, which will help Ford in launching new products.

The agency collected 1001 data points from various channels to map the data for this project.

After rigorous testing of the data, they provided a compact and impactful dashboard to better understand the market scenario.

Letâ€™s understand the dashboard:

Based on average income across gender, the data shows that males have a higher income compared to females. Additionally, those with higher incomes are more likely to purchase cars.

Based on age, Middle-Aged individuals are more likely to buy cars compared to other age groups.

Based on Commute Distance, we observe that most cars are used for commutes of up to 1 mile. This suggests that buyers purchase cars primarily for short-distance travel, such as commuting to work or business.

Other key variables, such as Education, Region, and Marital Status, also influence car purchases but are dependent on specific conditions.
